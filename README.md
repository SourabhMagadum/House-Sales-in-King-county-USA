# House-Sales-in-King-county-USA
This is a regression model to predict the house prices of houses in King county on the basis of given features. Started the
problem by viewing, analysing and visualizing the relation and estimated effects of different features using various
visualization tools like Pearson Correlation Matrix, Histograms, Scatter plots, Box plots etc. Then I started modelling by
making 4 models. The First model was a basic linear regression model with only 1 independent variable and in each of the 
next models I incresed their complexity by forward feature selection by considering their correlation with the target variable. 
Then made a more complex model by considering all independent variables and used polynomial ridge regression.
